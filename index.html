    <!-- Chosen Palette: Serene Earth -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed for non-linear exploration, prioritizing user discovery over the report's linear structure. The core architecture is a central hub navigating to three main thematic sections: Self, World, and Transcendence. This structure was chosen because the report's primary insight is this three-part framework. It allows users to immediately grasp the core concept and dive into the pillar that interests them most. Within each pillar, interactive cards are used to present detailed philosophical concepts, preventing cognitive overload from long text blocks. An interactive chart at the beginning introduces the central conflict (bond vs. fetter), immediately engaging the user with the report's key tension. The final section visualizes the 'virtuous cycle,' synthesizing the three pillars into a memorable takeaway. This user-driven, modular design makes the dense philosophical content more accessible and digestible. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1.  Report Info: Contested interpretations of <em>Kizuna</em> (Traditional, Official, Critical). Goal: Compare. Viz Method: Interactive Bar Chart (Chart.js). Interaction: Clicking a bar reveals detailed text for that interpretation. Justification: A chart provides a clear visual comparison of the different viewpoints, while the interaction allows for a deep dive into the nuances of each without cluttering the initial view.
        2.  Report Info: The three-pillar framework (Self, World, Transcendence). Goal: Organize/Navigate. Presentation Method: Large, clickable navigation cards (HTML/CSS). Interaction: Clicking a card smoothly scrolls to the relevant content section. Justification: This creates a clear, visually appealing central navigation hub that forms the backbone of the user's journey through the application.
        3.  Report Info: Supporting philosophical concepts (Ikigai, Wa, Kami, etc.). Goal: Inform/Organize. Presentation Method: A grid of interactive cards (HTML/CSS). Interaction: Clicking a card reveals a detailed explanation in a dedicated content area. Justification: This "drill-down" approach breaks down complex information into manageable chunks, encouraging exploration without overwhelming the user.
        4.  Report Info: The integrated 'virtuous cycle' of the three pillars. Goal: Show Relationships. Presentation Method: An image of the core framework diagram. Interaction: None, static visual. Justification: Using the official, user-provided diagram ensures fidelity to the source material and provides a clear, aesthetically consistent visual anchor for the report's conclusion.

                The word <em>Kizuna</em> holds a powerful duality. While celebrated as a symbol of unity and support, its root kanji can also mean <em>hodashi</em> (fetters), suggesting social pressure and constraint. This section allows you to compare these contested interpretations. Click on a bar to learn more.

It's the process of self-realization, acceptance, and inner harmony. Explore the philosophical concepts below that help cultivate this essential bond.

It is the interwoven fabric of time, destiny, and relationships, a spiritual interconnection that gives shape and meaning to existence." },

This animistic view sees the divine in mountains, rivers, trees, and rocks, establishing an inherent, familial bond between humanity and the environment, fostering a powerful conservationist ethic." },

The universe is a vast web of mutually supportive relationships, deconstructing the illusion of a separate self and fostering a deep sense of universal compassion and responsibility." },

Through aesthetic ideals like Yūgen (profound grace), Mono no aware (pathos of things), and Ma (negative space), practitioners learn to perceive the interconnectedness of all things." }
